# Thesis Container  

# Interacting with Podman

Running a Container

Now you can run that container with the podman run command. Before we execute that, however, it is important to understand some of the often used flags.

Here are a few that I use often:

`-i`: This makes the container interactive
`-t`: This creates a temporary or pseudo terminal. This allows you to pass commands to the container.
`--rm`: This removes the container (but not the container image) when the container is stopped. This is helpful if you are testing the container and do not need to retain any changes you make. If you donâ€™t have this flag you will need to run manual commands to remove existing containers.
`-d`: This detaches the container. This is useful if you want to start a container that runs in the background and still use your WSL terminal.
`-p`: Forward a container port to a host port. This is required if the container is a server that needs to be accessible from a web browser. For instance, RStudio-Server, Jupyter Notebook/Lab, and many DBMS GUIs.
`-n`: Name the container to make it easier to find later. If this flag is not provided podman assigns a random name that consists of two words separated by an _.
In general, a podman run command looks like this:

`podman run <flags and input parameters> <container image>:<tag> <command (not required)>`
The following command runs the Ubuntu container with an interactive shell and deletes the container when it is stopped.

`podman run -it --rm docker.io/library/ubuntu:focal` 

As of 2021-02-05 there has been a change to Podman that breaks it when running in WSL2. To fix this you must pass two additional flags. An interactive `podman run` command should look like this:  

`podman run -it --rm --events-backend=file --cgroup-manager=cgroupfs docker.io/neilkester/thesis-rstudio:v1.2 bash` 

Run the pod in detached mode for RStudio with:  

`podman run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=mypass --rm --events-backend=file --cgroup-manager=cgroupfs docker.io/neilkester/thesis-rstudio:v1.2 bash`
